-- FORFEIT_COMPETITION_FIXTURE — add competition-scoped serialization
-- lock (UG-CR-GATE-083 per UG-CR-REV-054 finding 1). See
-- 20261005090000_add_serialization_lock_to_cancel_incomplete_competition.sql
-- for the full rationale. This function's ORIGINAL first operation
-- (after REASON_REQUIRED) was a FOR UPDATE lock on competition_fixtures
-- before competition_id was known. A small plain preliminary lookup now
-- resolves competition_id and checks FIXTURE_NOT_FOUND first;
-- competition_scope is acquired next; only then does the ORIGINAL FOR
-- UPDATE select run exactly as before. Every other line is unchanged
-- from
